                <h3>My Dream </h3>
                <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests
                    changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived,
                    one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately
                    pursue.</p>

                <h3>Computer Hobby</h3>
                <p>My parents always knew that I wanted a computer. I didn't know what was inside of the big brown box
                    until the next day when I saw the computer on my homework table. It was the best day of my life, for
                    that day my dream became reality. It was use but in good shape conditions and working.</p>

            <p>Computers are part of our everyday lives. From writing notes, to binging Netflix, your computer
                heck of a machine. But do you actually know how a computer does all these things? Computers are often
                seen as a black box technology far too advanced for our little brains to comprehend. But when you strip
                it down to the basics, it isnâ€™t all that complicated.</p>
